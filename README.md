# NOMAD HYPERTEXT
Nomad Hypertext is a writing app built around semantic search. 

As your write, it indexes what you write in a local vector database, using a local AI model to generate embeddings. Later, you can click on paragraphs to see related content.

Nomad Hypertext was heavily inspired by Linus Lee's [notation.app](https://notation.app/) and its corresponding essay, [Hyperlink Maximalism](https://thesephist.com/posts/hyperlink/). Gordon Brander's essay [All you need is Links](https://subconscious.substack.com/p/all-you-need-is-links) also provided a lot of inspiration.
